# Youtube-automations

A basic python program written which uses web scrapping and YouTube API to perform certain functions such as downloading a video/playlist, and accesssing the data about the video and the playlist. 

# How to run the program
Before running the program, the user needs to generate a YouTube API key to use the resources of the YouTube API. This can be done by refering to this link-...
The program makes use of python libraries- pytube and requests.
Command to download both the libraries
1. pip install pytube
2. pip install requests

After this, run the program "main.py" to make use of the automations. When downloading a folder, the program creates a new folder with the name as that of the playlist and downloads all videos in that itself.
